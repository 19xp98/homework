#20 percent load of torque#
The rated output torque is about 407 N/m.
The no-load speed is 1789 rpm.
n = -0.095823T + 1789
While T = 325.6
n = 1757.8
The rotate speed difference between the rated torque and 80 percent of torque is 7.8 rpm.
In the simulink, the rated rotate speed is 1753 and the speed with 80 percent of torque is 1760 thus the difference is about 7.
